Honestly, my gut feeling as to whether I would fit the program and get along well with the individuals at that institution played a big part in my decision making process. Another factor was how personable the preceptors were during the interview day, in addition to how knowledgeable they are in general (which I tried to get at by learning more about the preceptors' residency training sites, mentors, and backgrounds). I will be spending an entire year learning from these individuals, and I do not think I will get the most out of my residency experience if I am intimidated by them or if I do not think the institution's teaching style is compatible with my learning style. I also considered how happy the residents seemed, and what their responses were to some of my questions -I looked at whether different residents responses were cohesive or not, and whether the residents seemed to get along well with each other. While there were several other factors that I looked at during the ranking process, these few that I have mentioned were probably the most important.",

28,3,The day went by very smoothly and we had different opportunities to ask questions. All preceptors were very receptive and were able to address all of our questions.,

The MMI's werent structured well in a large room where there were many distractions. The RPD's didn't really make me feel comfortable - it was just an awkward day compared to my other interviews.",
6,3,I appreciated that Dr. Gulbis took time out of his day to focus on the residency candidates. I felt that we had a lot of time and opportunity to speak with him as well as the other preceptors. I appreciated the tour and could honestly tell there was genuine respect and friendship between the residents (both PGY1 and PGY2),

3,4,"I had prior experience with MMI, and thought the scenarios Memorial Hermann TMC had prepared were actually quite fun! I though the directions for the journal article scenario were not very clear. I was under the impression that I was expected to provide a 'casual' explanation of an article to a fellow classmate; however, when I was done and saw the subtle reactions of my interviewers, it seemed that I was expected to present as if I were presenting to a group of preceptors. This is probably my mistake and not the directions, as I was excited and nervous during the process (as expected). To prevent further misunderstandings, an emphasis may be provided to the candidates, stating that their presentation is to a group of preceptors (if the aim is to get them to be more formal in their presentation style) or to a classmate (if the aim is to have them explain the article more casually, easier to understand manner).","No, it did not affect how I ranked the program"
2,4,"I was nervous for the MMIs at first, but I think they were very appropriate and I think it would be a better way to see how people react other than asking them behavioral related questions.","Yes, I ranked the program higher"

15,6,Other programs had more opportunities in my speciality area,
14,6,limited PGY2 options was a big tie breaker,
13,6,I honestly believe MH-TMC has an outstanding residency program and would provide a rigorous clinical training experience. I also had extremely positive interactions during my interview and have always been impressed by the professionalism exhibited by representatives of the program. The reasons I ranked other programs above MH-TMC were because they had more PGY-2s in my areas of interest and I felt I fit in better with the people at those institutions.,

7,6,"I was never asked during a single interview why I wanted to do a residency or why I felt I would be a good candidate for Memorial Hermann. I don't think situational questions (""tell me about a time""..) accurately give an sense of who I am as a candidate. They also gave me no ability to form connections with the interviewers.",

5,6,NA,
4,6,Memorial Hermann-TMC was my first choice but I ended up swapping it around before the deadline mainly because I felt I had a better connections with preceptors from my first choice rank program.,
3,6,"Other programs had PGY2 program availabilities that are more aligned with my current interest areas. Additionally, the response I got for one of my questions about the research project selection process was inconsistent between residents vs. interviewers. Finally, the residents on the day of my interview seemed very exhausted, and I got the impression that the residency class was not as close to one another as I have seen in other programs. As mentioned, the differences among my top 4 programs were minor, so small reasons and impressions such as the ones listed above (which are not very important in the grand scheme of things) played a role in my final decision making.",

26,7,Perhaps having the interviews in more private rooms so it is more individualized,
25,7,A more organized manner to talk to preceptors. I felt that I was not able to talk to everyone I wanted to because other candidates were already talking to them and it was a bit too formal. I think having the preceptors around for half of lunch would be a good option.,
24,7,"For me, I think I would have preferred to be in individual rooms as the atrium was somewhat distracting with various conversations going on all at once.",

14,7,I enjoyed the interview day. I really enjoyed the tour and the ample time to ask questions. I also felt Dr. Gulbis RPD was readily available to us. The journal articles were a little nerve wracking but ended up okay. It was hard to gauge how some people felt about me when interacting with them.,
13,7,NA,
12,7,"For those candidates who never have experience with MMI prior to the interview, it could be a disadvantage as compared to candidates who have experience with MMI.",
11,7,"Overall, I like the way the interview day was organized. The standard interview and MMI help to understand the interviewee while the rest of the day was more informal and allowed time to interact with residents and preceptors.",
10,7,The preceptor meet and greet should have included more preceptors.,
9,7,NA,
8,7,Perhaps more preceptors could attend the Preceptor Meet and Greet,
7,7,"-- Hold MMI's in different location where candidates can concentrate on the questions being asked. -- Consider clinical cases that expound on a potential candidates clinical skills in acute care -- NOT ambulatory care (RSI, pharmacotherapy for patients who are intubated, clot/bleeding, sepsis) -- Ensure more preceptors go to meet and greet (only had 2-3 preceptors there) -- Get to know residents personality instead of what they've done, but rather what they can do. -- Discuss with residents importance of getting to know the residents and not use the lunch to discuss personal things amongst themselves.",
6,7,"Overall, the interview day was efficient, well thought-out, personable and welcoming. I enjoyed that the day was spent with other candidates to lessen the stress of the day.",
5,7,NA,
4,7,"I would not conduct the interviews in such an open, public area. I was not distracted by the people walking overhead, but more so by the fact that I could hear some other candidates answering at neighboring tables. Because of the echo in the room, I heard their answers and lost my train of thought. I would suggest trying for a more quiet conference room or less public area to conduct the interviews.",
3,7,"I thought the residency interview day you had planned at Memorial Hermann TMC was excellent. The tour provided was impressive and detailed, so it would be to the program's (and also future candidates') advantage if it is continued to be provided in the same way. I have noticed that the less intimidating the whole process is (and by that I mostly mean the way interviewers interact with the candidates, how they answer the questions posed, whether they change their tone of voice if asked to respond to a criticism or what may be thought of as a negative comment or not, etc.), the easier it is for candidates to feel comfortable and really be themselves. I thought Memorial Hermann TMC did a good job with this; the only reason I wanted to mention it here is because I saw it as a strength (but there is always room for improvements), and want the program to continue to be this way and ensure all interviewers are aware of this fact as one that is important in the eyes of some candidates. I want to note here that I was humbled to have been selected for an interview at your institution; I am certain you get hundreds of applications from highly qualified candidates. I hope my feedback will be of use to the program.",
